# Roll20 Macros Repository

This repository is a collection of various macros for use with [Roll20](https://roll20.net/), an online virtual tabletop platform. Many of these macros may be partially or wholly sourced from other creators, but their origins have unfortunately been lost to time. They are gathered here for ease of use, adaptation, and improvement.

## Overview

These macros are intended to enhance and simplify gameplay in Roll20, making it easier to perform common actions, manage spells, handle combat, and automate repetitive tasks for both players and Game Masters.

## Getting Started

To use these macros inside a character sheet on Roll20:

1. **Open Your Character Sheet**: Log in to Roll20, open your game session, and navigate to the character sheet where you want to add the macro.
2. **Locate the Attributes & Abilities Tab**: Click on the **Attributes & Abilities** tab within the character sheet.
3. **Create a New Ability**: Click on **+ Add** under the Abilities section to create a new macro.
4. **Copy and Paste**: Copy the desired macro from this repository and paste it into the ability editor.
5. **Save and Use**: Name the macro appropriately, check any options for visibility or token action, and save it for use during gameplay.

## Categories

The macros in this collection cover a range of actions, including but not limited to:

- **Combat and Actions**: Basic rolls, attacks, and skill checks.
- **Spells and Abilities**: Commands for spellcasting, saving throws, and ability checks.
- **Utility**: Macros for general tasks like healing, tracking resources, or applying effects.

## Usage Notes

- These macros can be customized to suit different campaigns, characters, or rules.
- They are designed to work with common character sheet templates in Roll20, but some adjustments may be needed for different game systems or custom sheets.
